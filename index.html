<p><h1>Status of a file in git <h1>
  If you don't add a file in git, it will mark it as untracked. If you make
  changes in that untracked file it will still show it as untracked and not
  modified. You have to add the file first. Modified files means that the files
  are changed or something is changed in them. Unmodified files means that there
  are no changes in those files. Staged file is a file that is ready to be
  commited. The file is added but not commited.
